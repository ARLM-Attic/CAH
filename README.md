CAH
========

![Screenshots](https://raw.github.com/cjarnold/CAH/master/screenshots.jpg)

CAH is a work in progress pass-and-play <b>android</b> clone of the <b>Cards Against Humanity</b> party game.
The official version of Cards Against Humanity can be found here: http://cardsagainsthumanity.com/
This android application is in no way sponsored by cardsagainsthumanity.com.  It is a personal project I have undertaken to learn android development.  

Just like the official game, CAH is distributed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/).  This restricts CAH from appearing in any app store such as Google Play.  The best I can do is provide the .apk file for download [here](https://raw.github.com/cjarnold/CAH/master/CAH.apk).    
 
I want to emphasize this is a <b>single device pass-and-play</b> version.  There is no online/bluetooth/wifi multiplayer.  I would like to someday turn this into an online version but I do not have a timeline on that.  Sorry!

Most testing has taken place on a Galaxy S3 with Jelly Bean.  There may be an issue where text will not wrap in some cases on Gingerbread devices.  I am looking into it.  

This is my first android project and I am learning as I go.  Any feedback is appreciated.

Note: CAH requires android.permission.INTERNET for sending crash reports (uses the [ACRA](https://github.com/ACRA/acra) library).
